Ultrabay replacement parts
==========================

# Ultrabay catch
A 3D printable replacement for the ultra bay locking slider. Normally this part can only be purchased together with the base cover assembly for around ~40$.
That's a lot of money for a small broken plastic piece. This part can be printed in a SLA process for less than 1$.
